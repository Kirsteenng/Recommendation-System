# Movie Recommendation System using Alternating Least Square Matrix Factorization

Dataset: [Movielens Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/)
In this exercise I have downloaded the [small dataset](https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-latest-small.zip). Please save these data files in the same directory as the scripts and ALS model directory.

Goal: 
1. Understand the concept of Matrix Factorization and Alternating Least Square(ALS).
2. Understand how to use Spark ML.
3. Create a ALS recommendation system that can take user details, such as movie history, personal characteristics, as input and output movie recommendation.

Procedure:
1. Conduct EDA to understand the dataset. Will involve plotting charts and data analysis procedures.   
2. Select variables and parameters to be fit into ALS.
3. Build and test model.
