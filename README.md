# Movie Recommendation System using Alternating Least Square Matrix Factorization

Dataset: [Movielens Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/)

Goal: 
1. Understand the concept of Matrix Factorization and Alternating Least Square(ALS).
2. Understand how to use Spark ML.
3. Create a ALS recommendation system that can take user details, such as movie history, personal characteristics, as input and output movie recommendation.

Procedure:
1. Conduct EDA to understand the dataset. Will involve plotting charts and data analysis procedures.   
2. Conduct PCA to identify significant variables.
3. Select variables and parameters to be fit into ALS.
4. Build and test model.
